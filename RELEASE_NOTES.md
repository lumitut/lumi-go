### üîß Improvements
- **Faster Startup**: Service starts immediately without waiting for databases
- **Smaller Docker Image**: Reduced image size by removing unnecessary components
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: External services managed independently
- **Simplified Configuration**: Single JSON file + environment variables
- **Improved CI/CD**: Added GitHub Actions workflows for CI, security, and releases

### üìö Documentation
- Added comprehensive development guide
- Created quickstart guide for getting started in 5 minutes
- Added external services integration guide
- Updated API documentation (OpenAPI and Proto)
- Improved README with clear architecture overview

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed test compilation issues with new config structure
- Resolved linting errors in test files
- Fixed configuration validation

### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### Configuration Changes
```bash

# Optional: Run external services separately
cd ../lumi-postgres && docker-compose up -d
```

#### Code Changes
```go
// Old
cfg.Database.Host
cfg.Redis.Host
